# C-Collections
A small library of C "template" data structures.

[TODO](#todo)

So this is really just a library of common data structures that i otherwise find myself rewriting all the time.
Most of the data structures are implemented with a *kind of* template-engine using macros to generate code for a specific type.
The containers also have foreach loops, they too implemented with macros.
Everything in here covers only basic functionality.
